# Automated Web Development Environment

![](images/Jenkins-Github-Server.png)

Directory "Website" consists of all the files of the Website that I used for creating a Web Development Environment by interating Git/Github, Jenkins and apache Web Server in Redhat 8. I have written a well documented article in my LinkedIn Handle explaining how we can create an web development environment using these technologies. I have used my another account ie, <a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26-DevOps">Abhinav-26-DevOps</a> for practising DevOps tasks. Also I have attached some of my YouTube videos in the article for better understanding of the installation and setting up the environment for the automation. To read my article on creating a complete end-to-end automated web development environment where you can create your websites as well as deploy you website <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-create-web-development-environment-integrating-gitgithub-dubey/?trackingId=Oac6FTCIQa2K09op%2FJMLvg%3D%3D">click here.</a>
